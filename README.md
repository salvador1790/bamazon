# bamazon

Bamazon is a CLI application that will allow customers to buy items that are stored in the database that the application is connected to. It will display the items available for sale by their Name and Id. It will also show the price of each item. The app will ask the user what item they would like to purchase and ask how much quantity. If the quantity is enough to fulfill the order, then it will place the order. If not, then it will alert the customer that there is not enough items to place the order. 

Technologies Used: Node.JS/MySQL

Here is a video link that will explain and show how the application works! https://drive.google.com/file/d/1r5txRykDSQ20Kk84JsnslKmE6HsgcqSN/view
